                    <p id="p1">
                        Well, looking at the current online environment of Trinidad and Tobago I noticed that unlike
                        other more developed countries many of our stores and businesses didnt have an online presence.
                        Often times you would need to get recommendations from friends or family about local stores. So
                        we here at Trindex aim to make finding local stores and businesses easier.
                    </p>

            <div>
                <h2 class="header2-2">Our Goal</h2>
                    <p id="p2">
                        To help Trinbagonians and visitors to this country find the
                        best local stores and businesses that suits their needs.
                    </p>
            </div>

            <div>
                <h2 class="header2-3">Future Plans</h2>
                    <p id="p3">
                        We plan to implement rating systems and allow users to add their own
                        stores and businesses that they would like to recommend to other users.
